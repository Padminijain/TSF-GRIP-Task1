## Task 1- Prediction using Supervised ML
### Author- Padmini Jain
#### Data source- "http://bit.ly/w-data"

#### Probelm statement:-
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

#### What is done:-
The first step performed was to import the necessary libraries and then the dataset was loaded. Then Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was done to highlight the shape, columns, value counts, etc. The correlation between the atrributes observed through Heatmap. 
After visualization, the data was split into Training and testing dataset. Linear Regression model was used for prediction.

#### Conclusion:-
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):- 4.4197278080276545
Mean Squared Error (MSE):- 22.96509721270044
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):- 4.792191274636316
The predicted score is 83.12 if a students studies for 8.25 hours per day.
